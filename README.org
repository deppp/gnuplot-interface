#+TITLE: gnuplot-interface package

Low level interface to gnuplot that strives to provide:
- start of gnuplot process
- passing raw gnuplot commands
- examining of sent commands 
- windows management


Typical usage:
#+begin_src lisp
(start-gnuplot) ;; starts the process
(init-gnuplot) ;; initializes terminal
(hello-world) ;;  test output
(command "command-string") ;; send command to gnuplot
(echo-command) ;; sell last sent command
#+end_src



The interface has been developed and tested on =sbcl= on Linux and
=clisp= on cygwin.
Operation on these platforms requires the following features to be declared
- sbcl ::  =sbcl= 
- clisp :: =clisp= and =linux= or =clisp= and =cygwin=
  
  
Caveats:
- stream plumbing is not thoroughly tested
- windows management is also not thoroughly tested
