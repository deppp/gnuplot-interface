#+TITLE: gnuplot-interface package

Low level interface to gnuplot that provides:
- start of gnuplot process
- passing raw gnuplot commands
- examining of sent commands 


Typical usage:
#+begin_src lisp
(start-gnuplot) ;; starts the process
(init-gnuplot) ;; optional, to initializes terminal
(hello-world) ;;  test output
(command "command-string") ;; send command to gnuplot
(echo-command) ;; sell last sent command
#+end_src

For passing complex gnuplot commands that consists of many lines, use
the =send-line= and =send-line-break= commands

The interface has been developed and tested on =sbcl= on Linux and
=clisp= on cygwin.  On =cygwin= it works with cygwin's gnuplot and
also the windows executable =wgnuplot=.

For use of cygwin+wgnuplot, one needs to provide the
feature :wgnuplot.  Furthermore, one needs to set :wgnuplot's property
list as
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(setf (symbol-plist :wgnuplot)
   (list :executable "posix compliant path to executable"))
#+END_SRC
For example, the path can be:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
"/c/Program\\ Files/wgnuplot/binary/gnuplot.exe"
#+END_QUOTE
  
Caveats:
- stream plumbing is not thoroughly tested
- windows management is not implemented

Todo:
- Use trivial-shell for communication to the process
- multiple windows management
